# Object_Detection
Object detection with YOLO and OpenCV.

I used pretrained model of [YOLO v3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) for this project. This provides a simple web interface to the user, where they can upload a photo and perform Object Detection.


### Steps to run it on your system:


1:clone this repository using
>git clone https://github.com/Sonkaryasshu/Object_Detection.git

2:Recommended step *[Optional]*: [Create virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
>python3 -m venv env

Activate virtual environment 
>source env/bin/activate

3:Change directory to current project
>cd path/to/repo/Object_Detection

4:Install requirements
>pip install -r requirments.txt 

5:Run the app.py file
>python app.py

-Now open localhost:5000 i.e. http://127.0.0.1:5000 and use as normal web application
